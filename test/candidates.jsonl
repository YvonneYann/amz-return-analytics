I understand that it wont be perfect since it depends on the sink. I found the utensil holder too large to fit well. It should be shorter so it stays in place."}

The mechanism that makes it sizable causes you to have a “ledge” where dishes can’t sit evenly. Even though my sink fits firmly between the sizing the silverware cup doesn’t clip on because the bar is in the way. Additionally it doesn’t actually sit straight because it’s bent out of shape."}
